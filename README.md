## Flight DElay Analysis

### Objective:
The primary objective of this analysis is to explore, analyze, and identify key factors contributing to flight delays across the United States from 2019 to 2023.
By leveraging comprehensive data from the US Department of Transportation, the analysis aims to uncover patterns and correlations between various 
delay factors (such as weather, carrier issues, and late aircraft) and overall departure delays. The insights gained will help stakeholders, including airlines 
and policymakers, develop strategies to minimize delays, improve operational efficiency, and enhance passenger satisfaction.

### Data Source:
- Provider: US Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics
